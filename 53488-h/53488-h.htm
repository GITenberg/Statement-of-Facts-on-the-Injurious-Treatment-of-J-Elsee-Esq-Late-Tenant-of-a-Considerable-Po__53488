5</span>STATEMENT, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> statements which will be found
in this pamphlet, will probably startle the minds of most persons
who may give them a perusal; reflecting as they do upon the
administration of justice, and the conduct of an official board,
which is invested with the power of transacting certain business
in the name of the crown, and on behalf of the nation.&nbsp; In
such cases, the highest degree of liberality might reasonably be
expected.&nbsp; Those petty interests that sow dissentions
between individuals <i>ought not</i> to exist in transactions
between individuals and the representatives of the national
authority; and, certainly, no <i>prejudiced motives</i>, or
<i>personal feeling</i>, should be permitted to operate to the
prejudice of the weaker party.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however,
persons who ought to rise <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>infinitely superior to all paltry
hostility, and mean jealousies, do not always separate their
prejudices from their duties; and they are also often led by the
nose by impertinent and interested servants, who, in reality,
become the masters of their nominal superiors, and dictators to
those whom it is their business to obey.</p>
<p>Much injustice is frequently occasioned in such manner; but
after a perusal of our narrative, we think we may fairly
challenge the production of any instance in which so much
pecuniary injury has been sustained, accompanied by so much
outrage to the feelings of a respectable, unoffending, and highly
meritorious individual;&mdash;upon one, who, during a long and
active life, in public and private, has conducted himself in the
most exemplary manner; against whose reputation no one has ever
dared to point the finger of reproach, and who having gained a
considerable fortune by his own unaided exertions, the most
persevering industry, and the most scrupulous integrity in his
dealings, had an undoubted right to expect <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the protection
of his interests by persons who were acting as trustees for the
nation; instead of being insulted, and entrapped into legal
difficulties by their agents, and plundered of a large sum of
money, without the slightest pretence for, or justice in, such an
outrageous attack upon the sacred right of private property.</p>
<p>And when, in addition to this, the reader shall reflect, that
these occurrences took place within a very few miles of the
metropolis, and were directed against an individual well-known
and highly respected, both in his own neighbourhood and the
metropolis itself, the scene of his prosperous exertions for so
many years, the astonishment will be proportionately encreased;
for if the rapacity and insolence of the servants of a public
board can be audaciously exhibited towards an individual so
situated in life, what misery and ruin may they not have entailed
upon the poor and defenceless, who are prostrate at the feet of
such oppressors.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee, to whom our narrative relates,
has fortunately escaped the <i>total ruin</i>, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>with which he
was unblushingly threatened&mdash;but the sacrifices which he has
been compelled to make, might have <i>broken the hearts</i>, and
<i>exhausted the means</i>, of hundreds who would have thought
themselves possessed of a competency for the wants of a
respectable subsistence. <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>With
these requisite preliminary observations, we shall proceed with
our narrative, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>premising also, that these pages are written in
illustration and support of <i>memorials to both the houses of
parliament</i>, as well as to the commissioners of woods and
forests, for such redress as Mr. Elsee has yet a just right to
expect will be afforded to him, if the honest attention of the
principals in the latter office can be drawn <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to the
subject; for the agents of government can have no true or lasting
interest in the injury of any one of his majesty&rsquo;s
subjects; and the liberal principles lately adopted by some of
the most influential of his majesty&rsquo;s advisers, encourage a
hope that their liberality may be extended to the actual
administration of impartial justice, and not be confined to empty
parliamentary professions.</p>
<p>Mr. John Elsee, at the period to which this narrative refers,
was a gentleman residing on his own freehold estate, at Chigwell
Row.&nbsp; He had been many years in business as a wholesale
stationer, in Queen-hithe, in the premises now occupied by the
Lord Mayor, and this part of the city became the market for paper
by the exertions of Mr. Elsee.&nbsp; Having realized a
considerable property, he retired from business, and having spent
the earlier portion of his life in agricultural business, he
purchased a freehold in the neighbourhood before mentioned, and
became also the lessee of part of Havering Park farm.&nbsp; This
farm, containing altogether about 1000 acres, was <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>held under
the crown, by a lease granted in the time of King William and
Queen Mary, to John Hampden, and Thomas Lovell, at a nominal
rent; it afterwards became the property of the Ladbrook family,
and was divided into two farms, one being let by Ladbrook to a
Mr. Thomas Hall, and the other to Mr. Elsee, whose lease expired
in 1815, and he continued as <i>tenant at will</i> to Miss
Ladbrook, three of the family which had granted his lease having
died during its continuance; and Miss Ladbrook told Mr. Elsee
that she did not intend to apply for a new lease.&nbsp; Mr.
Elsee, therefore sent in a memorial in the usual way, having been
told at the office that Miss Ladbrook&rsquo;s lease would expire
at Lady-day, 1818, <i>but to such memorial Mr. Elsee never
received any answer</i>; though <i>it had been the usual
practise</i>, <i>for many years</i>, <i>on the part of the
commissioners of woods and forests</i>, <i>and land revenues</i>,
<i>to signify by printed papers</i>, <i>affixed in their public
offices</i>, <i>and in other ways to make it publically
known</i>, <i>that if no application was made </i><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span><i>by the
tenants holding under lease of the crown</i>, <i>two years before
the expiration of their old leases</i>, <i>to renew their
holding</i>, <i>the commissioners would consider themselves open
to receive proposals from any other persons</i>, <i>to treat for
a lease or leases of such premises</i>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1817, Mr. Edward Driver, the surveyor to the
land revenue department, informed Mr. Elsee that he was not to
pay any more rent to Miss Ladbrook&rsquo;s executors, that her
lease had expired at Lady-day <i>then last past</i>, and that in
future the rent must be paid to the crown.&nbsp; From this Mr.
Elsee conceived the hope of obtaining the lease himself, the more
especially as Mr. William Masterman, <i>had been in a situation
precisely similar</i>, <i>on the expiration of his
landlord&rsquo;s lease</i>, and the commissioners had granted him
a new lease for 31 years, charging him for the interval between
the expiration of the old lease, and the day of his entering upon
the new one, <i>only the same rent which his former landlord had
paid to the crown</i>.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Driver said he was going <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to seize the
other part of the land comprized in the lease of Miss Ladbrook,
and held by Mr. Hall, for dilapidations.&nbsp; Mr. Driver
subsequently <i>made this seizure</i>; and then <i>requested Mr.
Elsee to take Mr. Hall&rsquo;s farm into his hands</i>, until the
final decision of the commissioners respecting the disposal of
the land was made known, it being then uncertain whether it would
be let or sold.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee declined this proposal, being
every year a considerable loser by the part he held, and only
retaining it in the expectation of having <i>his rent
reduced</i>, and obtaining a lease <i>on such terms as might
warrant him in the outlay necessary to afford a prospect of an
adequate return</i>; and in the intention of becoming a
purchaser, if the commissioners should decide upon the sale of
the land.</p>
<p>Besides this, Mr. Elsee felt that he had strong personal
claims to fair dealing, if not to liberal treatment, from the
commissioners; as, at their request, he had exerted himself in
the protection of crown rights in the forest, which were grossly
infringed by their own servants.&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>He had assisted to detect and bring
to justice the <i>under-keeper</i>, the <i>king&rsquo;s
woodward</i>, and others, <i>for stealing timber from the
forest</i>, a practice then carried on to a great extent. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Under
all the circumstances, therefore, Mr. Elsee had a right to expect
something like <i>justice</i>, if not liberality, on the part of
the commissioners; and if he had been in their hands, instead of
<i>the hands of their servants</i>, he probably might have
obtained it.</p>
<p>While in this state of suspense respecting a new lease, Mr.
Driver repeatedly informed Mr. Elsee, that he had received offers
for the farm previously occupied by Mr. Hall, at three times the
rent which Mr. Elsee considered it to be worth, and three times
as much as it was afterwards let for to a Mr. Ellis.&nbsp; This
statement, whether true, or otherwise, had the effect of
preventing Mr. Elsee from making any further offers,
<i>particularly as his previous application for a lease remained
unanswered</i>; and he urged Mr. Driver to get the amount of the
rent fixed which he was to pay to the crown, for the time <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>after the
expiration of Miss Ladbrook&rsquo;s lease, <i>and to name any
period when the crown wished to take possession of the
land</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Driver replied, that <i>if Mr. Elsee would
continue to hold the farm until Michaelmas</i>, 1819, (that was
another year) <i>he trusted that all would be settled by that
period</i>, and he would very shortly let Mr. Elsee know the
amount of rent that he was to pay, <i>but which was never
done</i>.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed without an arrangement and from the harsh
conduct of Mr. Driver to Mr. Hall, and other crown tenants, when
circumstances had placed them in his power, Mr. Elsee became
uneasy, and <i>wrote to request positive information as to
how</i>, <i>and when</i>, <i>he was to settle with the crown</i>,
<i>and surrender possession of the farm</i>.&nbsp; In answer to
this letter, Mr. Driver referred Mr. Elsee to Mr. Pillar, the
chief clerk; and on application to that gentleman, he said, <i>he
was surprized that Mr. Driver sent to him</i>, <i>as he did not
think that the commissioners would object to any arrangement that
Mr. Driver might think proper to make</i>; from which it may be
inferred, that the affair was <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>left entirely to that gentleman, from
whom, in a few days, Mr. Elsee received the following letter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">New Bridge-street, Oct.
12, 1818.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have been out of town the whole of last week, or I intended
to have written to you, on the subject of the farms at
Havering.&nbsp; I now beg to inform you the Commissioners have
not come to any determination as to the time of letting either of
the farms, only they are to be let, and not sold; and have
desired me to obtain offers from any person desirous of treating
with me for a lease of either of the farms.&nbsp; I shall
therefore feel myself happy to receive in writing any proposal
that you may be disposed to make, and it shall be forwarded in
the proper way, in the same manner as some other offers already
made will be forwarded.&nbsp; I shall be prepared very shortly to
make some agreement with you, as to your present holding, and,
for your continuing until Michaelmas next, before which time I
hope and trust the whole of those farms will be disposed of in
some way or other.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am yours, most truly,<br />
E. DRIVER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The farms not being to be sold, as Mr. Elsee <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>had been
induced to hope they would be, and the conditions in some printed
particulars forwarded to him by Mr. Driver, not appearing to
leave room for any advantageous holding under the crown, he
declined making any proposals, and was only anxious to get
extricated as speedily as possible from the farm, <i>which he had
continued to hold at the earnest request of</i> Mr. Driver,
<i>and with a view to facilitate any arrangements on the part of
the crown</i>; <i>as every day&rsquo;s holding was injurious
to</i> Mr. Elsee, <i>when he ceased to have the prospect of being
either the purchaser or lessee</i>. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
farms, however, were let before the Christmas of 1818; and Mr.
Elsee requested Mr. Driver to inform the gentleman who had taken
them, and had entered upon that of Hall, that Mr. Elsee was
desirous of letting him have possession of the other, and to sell
him any thing upon the premises, whenever it would suit
him.&nbsp; Mr. Driver promised to communicate this offer to the
new tenant, and then, for the first time, said, &ldquo;<i>he had
not yet done with Miss Ladbrook&rsquo;s executors</i>; <i>that he
meant to make them pay</i>, <i>double the rent that Mr. Elsee had
paid them</i>, <i>for the time he had held the</i> <i>farm</i>,
<i>since her lease expired</i>, <i>as she had never </i><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><i>given the
crown possession of that part of the land</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Elsee thought it impossible the Surveyor could be in
earnest, in such a monstrous and ridiculous proposition; and
replied, &ldquo;<i>surely</i>, <i>you obtained possession</i>,
<i>when you entered on Hall&rsquo;s part</i>; <i>for at the time
you surveyed Hall&rsquo;s part of the farm</i>, <i>and took
possession of that</i>, <i>you also went over and surveyed the
part held by me</i>; <i>and you know very well that possession
has been offered to you again and again</i>.&nbsp; <i>You have
also given me directions to get boards painted and fixed up at
different parts</i>, of both farms, <i>to warn people from
sporting and shooting</i>, <i>and you have afterwards paid me for
these things</i>, <i>while I have done every thing in my power to
accommodate you</i>, <i>by staying on the farm at your own
particular request</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reply should have been conclusive, for if the crown were
not in possession, the fault rested only with its own
Surveyor.&nbsp; No wish to hold over was entertained either by
the executors, or by the tenant at will; nor was <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>there, in
fact, any holding over, for Mr. Driver had taken actual
possession, had directed the rent to be paid to the crown, and
acted as the possessor of the property on behalf of the
crown.&nbsp; It was therefore a paltry quibble, and a meanness of
which any landlord should have been ashamed, to have taken
advantage of a mere informality, if it had existed, which however
does not appear to have been the case, <i>as the land had only
been held at all at the Surveyor&rsquo;s own particular
request</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Driver, however, for some purpose of his own, thought
proper to disregard the justice of the case, and replied that
&ldquo;Mr. Elsee was not the tenant of the crown; that Miss
Ladbrook&rsquo;s executors had behaved very ill; that there was
no complaint whatever against Mr. Elsee, who could come upon the
executors for any injury that he might sustain; that he (Mr.
Driver) was determined to bring an action of ejectment against
the executors; that Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s crops would be seized on
the premises the next summer, and that he might sue the executors
for the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>damages.&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Elsee, who
saw in the consequent expence nothing but mischief to all
parties, except Mr. Driver, if the threat were really carried
into execution, waited upon the solicitors of the executors of
Miss Ladbrook, informed them what had passed, and begged them to
see Mr. Driver, and make an arrangement to prevent the seizure of
the crops, and the unpleasant results of such a
litigation.&mdash;These respectable solicitors, Messrs. Windus
and Holtaway, were not to be frightened; they knew the man they
had to deal with, and after some severe remarks on the
Surveyor&rsquo;s conduct, they declared that they would have
nothing to say to him, that they had never held over, and that he
might do his worst.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>With
this answer Mr. Elsee returned to Mr. Driver, who had left word
that the report was to be made to Messrs. Jones and Green, the
solicitors to the office of woods and forests, to whom Mr. Elsee
repaired, and <i>was then informed by Mr. Jones that he did
not</i> think <i>the crown would require more rent than had been
paid to</i> Miss Ladbrook; but that he would see Mr. Pillar, and
make enquiry at the office, and acquaint Mr. Elsee with the
result; which, by the bye, he never did.</p>
<p>The Surveyor proceeded as he had threatened he would, with his
action of ejectment; and during its progress, he forwarded a long
agreement to Mr. Elsee for his signature, the effect of which was
to put him in the place of the executors, when judgment should
have been obtained against them, and leave him entirely at the
mercy of the crown.&nbsp; This agreement, too, had been framed
without any consultation with Mr. Elsee, upon its conditions,
some of which were contrary to the custom of farming leases, and
all of them framed in opposition to the situation and interest of
a <i>tenant </i><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>at will</i>, which the Surveyor had declared him to
be, <i>and not in any way a tenant of the crown</i>.&nbsp; This
attempt to encrease the responsibility of Mr. Elsee was answered,
of course, by a refusal to sign it; the agreement was returned,
and Mr. Elsee waited upon the Surveyor, and pointed out to him
that he was not liable to <i>any conditions</i>, and still less
to the unreasonable ones attempted to be imposed upon
him&mdash;that there was no legal claim upon him for dung <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a>&mdash;that he had paid for it on his
entrance <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>upon the farm, and it would be his property when he
should give up possession.&nbsp; To this the Surveyor replied,
<i>that he had let the farm on such conditions</i>, <i>and the
new tenant was to do the same during his lease</i>.&nbsp; It was
then enquired by <i>what right</i> the Surveyor made such
conditions with respect to <i>this farm in particular</i>, since
<i>he had not made them with respect to Heaton&rsquo;s</i>?&nbsp;
The Surveyor made answer, that they &ldquo;<i>would be made to
leave all their dung</i>,&rdquo; which, however, <i>was not the
case</i>, for in the following summer the crops of that farm, and
<i>also the dung</i>, <i>were sold by the owner</i>. <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>It was
further remarked to the Surveyor in this conversation, that
<i>spit dung</i> was specified, and that it was not always to be
procured; to which the Surveyor said it was so stated in all
leases, meaning that, or an equivalent in other manure.&nbsp; Mr.
Elsee again insisted that the dung was as much his property as
the hay and corn; and further objected to the expence of the
agreement as <i>unnecessary</i>, as the Surveyor <i>knew</i> he
was ready to quit the farm at any time.&nbsp; The Surveyor,
notwithstanding all this, held to his purpose, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> and pretended that the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>thing must be
done <i>regularly</i>; that the whole of the expence would not be
more than 60<i>l.</i> or 70<i>l.</i> that the crown would pay
half, and would further give time from Michaelmas 1819, to the
following Lady-day, to thrash out the corn, and otherwise dispose
of the property to the best advantage&mdash;that the crown
besides would pay for all <i>improvements</i>, <i>laying down
ploughed fields to grass</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; In spite of
these temptations Mr. Elsee refused to sign; had he remained firm
in this refusal, and acted upon the advice of his friends, many
of whom recommended him not to put himself in the power of the
Surveyor by his signature, he might have saved himself some
thousands of pounds, and a degree of personal and family anxiety
even more to be deplored than his pecuniary loss. <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"

<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>In this
time the Surveyor had proceeded in his action of ejectment, and
as the day for the service of the declaration approached, Mr.
Elsee was applied to for his final decision as <i>to signing the
agreement</i>; and he found himself compelled to submit, even as
it was, with a reference to arbitration as to terms, &amp;c. or
to close the doors upon all reconciliation, and entail upon his
property the disastrous consequences of <i>a law-suit</i>,
<i>with the crown for an antagonist</i>. <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>In this
dilemma, the agreement, in an unfortunate moment, <i>was
signed</i>, and the consequences proved still more mischievous
than those which the signing was intended to prevent; Mr. Elsee
being soon plunged into the legal embarrassments that it had been
his earnest <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>hope, and most anxious desire to avoid, by the very act
that involved him. <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>The leading articles of this fatal agreement, were, that Mr.
Elsee, <i>against whom the action neither was</i>, <i>nor could
have been brought</i>, should sign a Warrant of Attorney in
ejectment, <i>he</i>, <i>moreover</i>, <i>having been throughout
anxious to quit</i>; and for thus burthening himself with a
responsibility apparently attempted to be saddled on the
executors of Ladbrook, it was stipulated that he should have the
land without rent from Michaelmas, 1819, to Lady-day,
1820&mdash;to be paid for seed sown upon not less than 40, nor
more than 60 acres&mdash;to leave 60 <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>load of hay, and all the fixtures in
the house&mdash;to be paid for laying down ploughed land to
grass, and his other improvements&mdash;to be accountable for
dilapidations, if any, since the termination of Ladbrook&rsquo;s
lease&mdash;and arbitrators to be appointed to ascertain what
rent should be paid for the 2&frac12; years since the expiration
of the lease: and out of this sum the agreement set forth, as
under, the sums due to Mr. Elsee should be deducted, and allowed
to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the said W. Huskisson, W. Dacres Adams,
and Henry Dawkins, do hereby agree for and in behalf of his
Majesty, to and with the said John Elsee, his executors, and
administrators, to submit to, and abide by the decision and
determination, so to be made as aforesaid, and that whatever sum
or sums of money shall be so as aforesaid awarded to be paid by
them to the said John Elsee, for the value of the said fixtures,
seeds, and the hay to be left as aforesaid, and as a compensation
for laying down any of the lands as aforesaid, shall be allowed
to be retained by him, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, out of any sum which shall be awarded to be paid by the
said John Elsee to them, for the use and occupation of the said
premises, or for any other of the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Mr.
Driver and Mr. R. Peake were the parties appointed as
arbitrators, to settle the matters at issue, the former acting
for the crown, and the latter for Mr. Elsee.&nbsp; On the 14th of
July, 1819, they met, and rode over the farm, and took an account
of the house fixtures.&nbsp; They next went into the stack-yard,
and the Surveyor agreed to take for the crown, for the 60 load to
be left by the agreement, a stack that the men were just
finishing, and the first made that season, the price to be fixed
by the arbitrators.</p>
<p>Mr. Elsee proceeded with these two gentlemen to Mr. Ellis, the
new tenant, and Mr. Elsee offered to give up the farm at that
time, and to sell the in-comer any thing upon it.&mdash;Mr. Ellis
declined this offer, but wished to treat for some fields, which
lay convenient to those he had entered upon.&nbsp; These were ten
fields, containing 108 acres of unmowed grass, with the use of 17
acres of fallow in addition.&nbsp; The two arbitrators were to
fix the value, and they left the room for that purpose, but
returned without agreeing, as Mr. Driver would allow <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the fields
<i>to be worth no more than ten shillings an acre</i>,
<i>although the grass fields contained the whole years
crop</i>.&nbsp; Yet this same gentleman, required from <i>these
very fields</i>, <i>so valued by himself at ten shillings an
acre</i>, a return in dung and rent of <i>about five pounds an
acre</i>!&mdash;So different were his powers of appreciation,
when employed for and against Mr. Elsee.</p>
<p>It was, however, agreed at this meeting, that Mr. Ellis should
buy five fields of wheat straw, there being none in the farm upon
which he had entered, which was to be paid for at Michaelmas,
1819; and as the straw was required in part for thatching the
stacks of the season, Mr. Elsee, being anxious to accommodate the
new tenant, agreed to commence thrashing as soon as the harvest
was got in.&nbsp; All matters were to be left to the arbitrators,
as Mr. Elsee supposed, in a friendly way; and the new tenant
having agreed, on the proposition of Mr. Driver, to take the
stack of hay previously reserved for the crown, Mr. Peake&rsquo;s
clerk, to prevent any misunderstanding, drew up the
following.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This agreement, of course, was not made in the most distant
intention of invalidating the original agreement with the
commissioners, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>nor could it legally have any such effect, the
commissioners not being in any way parties to it; yet such an
effect was produced by the arbitrators, to the serious injury of
Mr. Elsee; <i>for they left him to seek payment from the new
tenant for the hay</i>, <i>fixtures</i>, <i>&amp;c. which it was
stipulated should be deducted from the rent due to the crown</i>;
<i>and the crown was made to demand in a most peremptory
manner</i>, <i>the whole of an enormously unreasonable award in
its favour</i>, <i>when Mr. Elsee</i>, <i>if he had been fairly
dealt with</i>, <i>even according to the conditions of the
agreement</i>, <i>which he had signed without any business to do
so</i>, <i>would have been a</i> creditor, <i>instead of a debtor
of the crown</i>.</p>
<p>Upon the memorandum we have quoted, it is necessary to remark,
that the two fields of wheat which was carried to Chigwell Row,
contained only 18 acres tenant&rsquo;s measure, and the whole
produce was carried at 13 loads, with three horses.&nbsp; The
weeds and rubbish of the bean field was four loads, <i>the bean
crop having entirely failed</i>, making together 17 loads.&nbsp;
Mr. Elsee took these crops for the straw, and proposed <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to bring back
all the spit-dung in his yard at Chigwell Row, and lay it in a
proper heap for measurement; and whatever excess of quantity
there might be in reference to the wheat straw, was to be set off
against the dung to be brought on account of the hay that might
afterwards be carried from the farm.&nbsp; This was agreed to,
and a place pointed out for its being brought to.</p>
<p>About a month from this date, the arbitrators met, and rode
over the farm, to view the crops, and see the dung that had been
carried.&nbsp; They measured one dung-hill, 75 feet long, 11
wide, and 3 deep.&nbsp; There was a second behind the hedge, but
they were so very zealous in the discharge of their duty, and so
very clever, <i>they thought it unnecessary to measure
it</i>.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the 26 and 16 acre field,
and looked at the dung and chalk rubbish which had been carried
there; and went on to Havering to dinner.&nbsp; Neither on this
occasion, nor on the 14th of July, did they attempt to go into
any business, nor did they give Mr. Elsee any opportunity, as he
had a <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span><i>right to expect</i>, <i>of proving by several
respectable farmers</i>, <i>who had long known the farm</i>,
<i>the value of the respective crops in every field</i>; <i>and
of the improvements that had been made</i>.&nbsp; It was
impossible to arrive at any just conclusion, <i>without giving
Mr. Elsee an opportunity of stating his own claims</i>, <i>and of
knowing the nature and extent of the claims preferred against
him</i>, <i>on many points of which explanations would be
necessary</i>.&nbsp; This reasonable expectation, however, was
totally disappointed; and Mr. Elsee heard nothing from the
parties who had thus assumed to themselves <i>the right of
disposing of his property without enquiry</i>, until the 29th of
September, <i>the time when Mr. Ellis was to have paid Mr. Elsee
for what he bought</i>; but instead of receiving his money from
Mr. Ellis, he only received information <i>that the time for the
settlement of matters between the commissioners and himself had
been extended for a month</i>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Mr. Ellis had completed nothing on his part
of the agreement; <i>but he had taken away a large quantity of
bean straw</i>, <i>sent his teams and people to take possession
of </i><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span><i>the farm</i>, <i>pitched his hurdles</i>, <i>and put
his large flocks of sheep into the barn mead</i>, <i>and
continued to fold them in the very field which he had agreed</i>
Mr. Elsee <i>should hold possession of till Christmas</i>, <i>and
for which the new tenant was to receive half the wheat
chaff</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Ellis kept continually fetching the straw,
hay, and chaff, <i>though it had not been appraised</i>, and his
taking possession of the field which Mr. Elsee should have had
until Christmas, drove the cattle of the latter <i>into the
stable</i>, <i>and they consumed the oat and bean straw</i>,
<i>chaff</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; In this situation of affairs,
and <i>the new tenant being a total stranger to Mr. Elsee</i>, he
wrote to his attorney to ascertain in which way he should act,
<i>as the agreement seemed null and void</i>, <i>or held in
defiance by the other party</i>, <i>and as much neglected by the
referees</i>.</p>
<p>While in such suspense, in the <i>November</i> ensuing,
without any more communication with the arbitrators, or any
acquaintance with their proceedings, except that Mr. Driver and
Mr. Peake could not agree, Mr. Elsee received an award to pay to
the crown the enormous <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>sum of &pound;2066: 3<i>s.</i>:
10&frac12;<i>l.</i> without any allowance whatever, and without
any reference to the credit side of Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s
account.&nbsp; We subjoin the award, that the document may assist
the commentary.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Such an award as this, when Mr. Elsee <i>expected to
receive</i>, <i>rather than to pay</i>, it will be allowed was
enough to startle any man; and we do not doubt of convincing
every unprejudiced reader, that more atrocious injustice was
never perpetrated under the form of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>In the first place, the umpire says, &ldquo;<i>he has </i><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span><i>duly
weighed and considered the matters in
difference</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this the short answer is, that
<i>he did not</i>; and for as short a reason, viz. that <i>he
could not have duly considered the matter</i>, <i>without an
examination of witnesses</i>, <i>and an enquiry into facts</i>,
<i>which were never made</i>, <i>either by the arbitrators</i>,
<i>or by himself</i>.&nbsp; It does not appear, that the umpire
ever made any proper survey, nor that he ever in any mode
acquainted Mr. Elsee with any part of his proceedings; and yet he
asserts that he had <i>duly considered everything</i>!&nbsp; He
cannot even pretend that he gathered his information from the
arbitrators, which he had no business to take, if they had been
ever so well qualified to give; <i>but the arbitrators had been
equally regardless of their duty</i>; they had done nothing
themselves, but left every thing in confusion, and could only
tell Mr. Mee that <i>there was a difference between them in the
slovenly estimate they had made</i>.&nbsp; This difference it was
the duty of the umpire to have settled by a proper enquiry,
<i>which the umpire did not make</i>, and therefore he did not
<i>duly</i> consider the case.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Mr. Mee
also says that he has made <i>just allowance</i> for the
<i>improvements</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> of <i>Mr. Elsee</i>.&nbsp; We
shall presently <i>shew</i> that he has <i>not</i> made
<i>any</i> allowance; but, on the contrary, that he has
enormously overcharged Mr. Elsee in the matter of rent, and made
no deduction whatever.&nbsp; Besides, we submit, that the umpire
ought to have set forth the articles that he estimated, and their
amount; the rent at which he valued the land; and every other
particular as fully as he sets forth the dung which was to be
brought by Mr. Elsee.&nbsp; If the umpire had ventured to do
this, <i>if he could have done it</i>, his <i>award</i> must have
looked so palpably preposterous, that an ideot might have been
ashamed of it.&nbsp; The only explanation we can offer of the
affair is, the supposition that the umpire, instead of examining
into the difference between the arbitrators, took Mr.
Driver&rsquo;s word, and made up this precious award under his
direction.</p>
<p>The rent that Mr. Elsee would have had to pay the executors of
Miss Ladbrook, at 375<i>l.</i> per annum, deducting the land-tax
at 40<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in two years and a half would have
amounted to 937<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>&nbsp; This was all that was
due to the crown, according to the <i>usual mode</i> of dealing
with crown tenants; and in the case of Masterman before quoted,
the commissioners did not charge him even the rent he had paid
under his own lease, but merely the rent paid by his landlord
under the old lease.</p>

<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>This
account leaves a balance of <i>seven pounds</i> against Mr.
Elsee; and yet the arbitrator makes him debtor, costs included,
in <i>more than two thousand pounds</i>, and that too after
professing to have made <i>due allowance</i> for the admitted
claims of Mr. Elsee!!! who did not in any fair view of the
question owe 10<i>l.</i> and with the additional expence of
endeavouring to obtain something resembling justice against this
award, Mr. Elsee has been a loser of near <i>four thousand
pounds</i>! <i>where he did not owe in justice even ten
pounds</i>.</p>
<p>The first questions that arise are, how this sum could be made
out?&mdash;upon what grounds the arbitrators could have
proceeded?&mdash;and what <i>could be</i> the <i>basis</i> of the
calculation?&mdash;We have before seen that Mr. Driver estimated
the <i>whole produce</i> of 108 acres of some of the best land on
the farm, <i>at only ten shillings per acre</i>.&nbsp; This was
about the rent paid by Mr. Elsee to Miss Ladbrook; and this
serves to <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>prove, that <i>even in Mr. Driver&rsquo;s opinion</i>,
the land was then let at its full value; and indeed the rent was
fixed by valuation by parties for Miss Ladbrook, at a period when
hay was at from 6<i>l.</i> to 8<i>l.</i> a load, and was
therefore a rack rent in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>But if the rent were <i>doubled</i>, and the fair allowance
made, the sum due to the crown would have been only 945<i>l.</i>
instead of nearly <i>two thousand</i>!&nbsp; And surely the
<i>doubling of the rack rent might have satisfied the consciences
of any arbitrators and umpires</i>.&nbsp; But no&mdash;it is only
by supposing that <i>this rack rent was trebled</i>&mdash;<i>that
land the produce of which was only valued at ten shillings an
acre</i>, <i>was charged a rent of thirty shillings an
acre</i>&mdash;we can arrive at something like the calculation of
the umpire!&nbsp; Is not this <i>a most wretched mockery of
arbitration</i>?&nbsp; It would be difficult to find any words to
characterise it, and it shall be left to the reader, as it
is.</p>
<p>The <i>costs</i>, perhaps, merit a word or two.&nbsp; In order
to colour the <i>modest charge</i> of <i>three hundred and
fifty-five pounds</i>, <i>eight shillings</i>, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>for <i>two
rides over a farm</i>, <i>measuring one dung-heap</i>, <i>and
looking at another</i>, by Messrs. Driver. and Peake, (what
<i>trouble</i> Mr. Mee took <i>not being in evidence</i>) the
costs are said to include <i>the expences of the ejectment which
had been so wantonly and unnecessarily incurred</i>, <i>and with
which Mr. Elsee had nothing to do</i>.&nbsp; Besides, as the
crown neither pays nor receives costs, <i>by what right did Mr.
Mee pretend to assess them</i>?&nbsp; How came they into his
umpirage?&mdash;We should like to see how they were carried to
the credit of the crown.&nbsp; The expence of the agreement may
be admitted, but the odd 55<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> would have been
an exhorbitant charge for it; so that we shall have the remaining
300<i>l.</i> to divide amongst the parties <i>for not doing their
duty</i>!&nbsp; We have heard of such matters, as making up a sum
for the sake of the <i>per centage</i>, but we make no such
charge; we are not conjurers enough to define motives&mdash;but
we repeat, that either from <i>sheer ignorance and gross
neglect</i>, or <i>a wilful disregard</i> of the interests of Mr.
Elsee, he has been injured to the amount of <i>several
thousands</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Another
circumstance occasioned Mr. Elsee to be still more astonished at
the award; and that was, <i>he had heard</i> Mr. Mee <i>declare
some years before</i>, <i>and when hay was selling at</i>
6<i>l.</i> <i>and</i> 8<i>l.</i> <i>per load</i>, <i>instead of
from</i> 2<i>l.</i> <i>to</i> 4<i>l.</i> <i>the price when the
award was made</i>, <i>that he would not work such a farm as</i>
Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s, <i>if he could have it rent free</i>!&nbsp;
Yet being umpire, he could <i>treble the rent</i>, <i>when
produce was lowered one half</i>, <i>and rents were being lowered
by every landlord in the country</i>.</p>
<p>On receiving the award, Mr. Elsee waited on Mr. Driver, to
remonstrate, but the Surveyor refused to interfere, as Mr. Mee
had made his award; although he admitted that the land-tax had
not been credited to Mr. Elsee, which circumstance alone called
for a second reference to the umpire, but the Surveyor evaded the
question, and could not be induced even to pay back this sum,
which is too clearly due to Mr. Elsee to admit of any
dispute.</p>
<p>Mr. Elsee also pointed out to Mr. Driver, that no credit was
given him for the dung he had already carted on to the farm; to
which Mr. <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Driver replied, <i>he supposed</i> it was left to set
off against the wheat straw which had been carried away; and
being told that there was an excess of 130 ton over what was
necessary in return for the wheat straw, he <i>very significantly
remarked</i>, <i>that the umpire had a different way of
estimating dung to what he had ever seen before</i>; as he called
40 feet of spit dung a load, while he (the Surveyor) had never
heard of a load being more than 27 feet.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee reminded
him, the weight of dung, or the load, depended upon the weight of
the hay or straw carried off; that if one horse was sent to
market with 36 trusses of straw, which weighed 11 <i>cwt.</i> 2
<i>qrs.</i> 8 <i>lb.</i> then 16 feet of good spit dung, weighing
12 <i>cwt.</i> would be an equivalent load; and that if 54
trusses weighing 17 <i>cwt.</i> 1 <i>qr.</i> 12 <i>lb.</i> were
taken away, 24 feet of dung, weighing 18 <i>cwt.</i> would be an
equivalent, and the same for a load of hay.&nbsp; Or if 108
trusses of straw, or one ton of hay, were carried, 27 feet of
spit dung was the fair return, as bringing back <i>weight for
weight</i> was all that could in justice be required, by any
landlord, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>while not one in a hundred obtained anything like so
much.&nbsp; To all this Mr. Driver could make no sort of reply,
and Mr. Elsee left him, after censuring the conduct of the
arbitrators, who, <i>after charging so much for their
trouble</i>, had settled nothing, not even making a list of the
fixtures, nor measuring the hay, nor crediting the amount of dung
carried, nor giving him any opportunity of stating his own
case.</p>
<p>The award did not even state <i>the quantity of dung that
remained to be brought</i>, or it would have been carted at once,
being quite ready for that purpose.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee was therefore
at a loss how to act, and imagined the only way left for him was
to carry the hay, and let the quantity of dung to be brought in
return, be assessed by a sheriff&rsquo;s jury, before which he
might prove the circumstances of the case;&mdash;but the servants
of the crown are not to be bound by the ordinary forms of
law.&nbsp; They have more effective instruments in their hands,
and instead of being called before a sheriff&rsquo;s jury, Mr.
Elsee was served with an exchequer process by no less a personage
than his Majesty&rsquo;s <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>attorney general; and an office copy
of the process cost <i>eighteen pounds</i>! in which it was set
forth a dozen times over, that he had taken from Havering Park
farm 300 loads of hay, and had not brought back 600 loads of
dung, for which the crown laid its damages at <i>six hundred
pounds</i>.</p>
<p>The consideration of this proceeding carries us back to
another part of the conduct of the arbitrators and the umpire,
namely the agreement with Mr. Ellis.&nbsp; In this instance,
there could hardly have been any occasion for an
<i>umpire</i>.&nbsp; There <i>was but little to do</i>, <i>and of
the commonest description of the business of valuation</i>,
<i>and part of the business</i>, <i>as the valuation of the
fixtures</i>, <i>and the stack of hay</i>, <i>was settled</i>;
but these arbitrators <i>were determined to have things done
regularly</i>, and as Mr. Mee had been made umpire in the other
affair, he <i>was also made umpire in this business</i>, <i>and
made his award one month after the time that Mr. Elsee ought to
have been paid for the property</i>.&nbsp; As there are some
remarks to be made upon this document, it is inserted.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a

loss sustained in this transaction, in which Mr. Elsee embarked
solely with a view of accommodating all parties, and of carrying
into effect the wishes of the Commissioners, as expressed by
their surveyor, <i>was upwards of five hundred pounds</i>; the
sum which was ultimately paid him he did not receive for three
years, <i>in consequence of the unauthorised transfer of the debt
of the crown to Mr. Ellis</i>, <i>and which might have been lost
altogether</i>, <i>if any misfortune had befallen the latter
gentleman</i>; and these things, coupled with the order to pay
down the enormous sum awarded to the commissioners, <i>render it
impossible to conclude that Mr. Elsee has been justly dealt
with</i>; <i>and there will neither be law</i>, <i>nor
equity</i>, <i>left to boast of</i>, <i>if a revision of these
proceedings cannot be obtained</i>, <i>against the influence of
Mr. Driver</i>.</p>
<p>If any such circumstances had existed in an agreement between
private subjects, there is no question but that both the awards
would have been easily set aside; but with the crown for an
antagonist, and the equity side of the exchequer for the scene of
action, a contest was <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>indeed desperate, in the face of the
enmity of a leading agent of the powerful party; so that after
Mr. Elsee had presented a memorial to the commissioners, who were
<i>induced probably by some misrepresentations from going into
the merits of the case</i>; and after having disputed the
validity of the general award, on the trial of an information in
the nature of an action for debt, filed upon it by the Attorney
General, the result was what might be very naturally anticipated,
from the conditions of the agreement which he had been entrapped
to sign.&nbsp; He was compelled to pay the sum that had been
awarded, and to bear the additional expence of his useless
endeavour to protect his own interests.&nbsp; At this period the
losses of Mr. Elsee amounted to <i>about three thousand
pounds</i>, but he was destined to be a still greater
sufferer.&nbsp; We have before mentioned that the Attorney
General filed an exchequer process for certain dung, claimed
under the agreement, instead of the more simple, cheap, and
equitable mode of sending the matter for assessment to a
sheriff&rsquo;s jury.&nbsp; Now, though Mr. Elsee <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>had no
business to have signed such a document, he was of course bound
by its conditions when he had done so, and was ready to comply
with them, and to carry back two loads of dung for every load of
hay, and one load of dung for every load of straw carried
off.&mdash;The dung was ready for the purpose; and he only waited
<i>to know what was to be brought</i>, <i>and to obtain credit
for what he had carried</i>, <i>which he never had been able to
do</i>.</p>
<p>The exchequer process terminated in a reference to Mr.
Bolland, whose general reputation stands on high ground; but who
appears in this instance <i>to have wanted that degree of
practical knowledge</i>, <i>which was requisite to enable a
referee to appreciate the value of the testimony given on both
sides of the question</i>; and it is difficult to guess at the
principles that governed the decision, except on the supposition
<i>that Mr. Bolland is a better lawyer than he is a
farmer</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Elsee attended to prove that he had carried <i>a large
quantity of dung</i>, which he estimated, and proved by his
witnesses, left 130 ton <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>to his credit, <i>after deducting the
quantity in return for the wheat straw</i>.&nbsp; He then shewed
by his <i>books</i>, in which the accounts of every day had been
regularly entered, in a way that set all contradiction and
suspicion at defiance, and by the production of the market
tickets, that the gross amount of all the hay carried from the
farm, amounted to 119 loads; and that the account stood as

dung admitted to have been carried, consisted of 143 tons, and
therefore about 99 tons in addition would have balanced the
account.&nbsp; The value of this dung, at 5<i>s.</i> per load was
25<i>l.</i> and at <i>this price any quantity could be obtained
at Romford</i>, <i>as Mr. Elsee proved by various respectable
witnesses</i>.&nbsp; Yet after this statement, can it be believed
that Mr. Bolland should award Mr. Elsee to pay the sum of
336<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> besides <i>all the expences
of the witnesses on both sides</i>, and <i>half the expences of
the reference</i>!&nbsp; To us, this is utterly
unaccountable.</p>
<p>Such witnesses on the other side, as Mr. Driver and Mr. Mee,
<i>had their previous conduct to justify</i>, if possible; and
Mr. Driver, who on a former occasion had told Mr. Elsee that he
had never heard of more than 27 feet to a load of dung, stated
now, upon his oath before Mr. Bolland that <i>fifty-four feet of
spit-dung was a load</i>, and that too as a set off against a
nominal load, namely 36 trusses, weighing 11 <i>cwt.</i> while 54
feet of dung weigh 42 <i>cwt.</i></p>
<p>Mr. Mee, who was said by Mr. Driver to <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>have a way of
his own when be estimated 40 feet to a load, found it necessary
to <i>alter</i>, but <i>not to mend his ways</i>; for not
thinking Driver&rsquo;s jump from 27 to 54 feet would make out
the calculation on their side, <i>even far the one dung-hill
which they did measure</i>, <i>but never cast up the contents at
the time</i>, he finally came to the conclusion that <i>sixty
feet of dung made a load</i>!&mdash;a piece of information, we
are bold to say, that no farmer ever heard of before. <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a></p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>The
absurdity and contradiction of the evidence against Mr. Elsee
were really preposterous.&nbsp; For instance, Mr. Mee measured
six stacks of hay 168&frac12; loads, 250 feet to the load; and
Mr. Harding measured the same stacks at 256 loads, 216 feet to
the load.</p>
<p>We have already disposed of this question, in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page52">52</a></span>, where the
principle of <i>weight for weight</i> is clearly defined; and
upon this plain principle, it is submitted, <i>Mr. Bolland ought
to have decided</i>.&nbsp; It was mere nonsense to go into any
enquiry as to what was a load; there must be a <i>determined
standard between the things</i>, or otherwise the condition of
the agreement was a <i>nullity</i>, and Mr. Mee and Mr. Driver
might with equal justice have demanded <i>barge loads</i>, or
even <i>ship loads</i> of dung, in exchange for <i>cart loads</i>
of hay.&nbsp; The obvious intention of the condition is to secure
weight for weight for the straw, and double the weight, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>or two loads
for one of hay.&nbsp; When, therefore, the weight of the hay and
straw was determined, the required quantity of dung was also
determined, and it only remained to be ascertained how much had
been carried, and what there was still to be brought; and making
every allowance for Mr. Bolland&rsquo;s want of agricultural
information, it is odd that he could overlook so evident a rule
of conduct.</p>
<p>Another point to be considered, is that Mr. Elsee <i>was not
permitted to carry the dung so improperly awarded to be due</i>;
but <i>he was compelled to pay in money</i>, at the rate of
<i>twenty shillings per load</i>, when he could have bought it at
<i>five</i>, and when, besides, he had it already <i>provided for
the purpose</i>; and the basis of this price was the assertion
that <i>it would cost</i> 20<i>s.</i> <i>to fetch a three horse
load from London</i>!&nbsp; Thus the quantity is first
exaggerated beyond all reason, and against the evidence of the
facts, and then the dung is refused, and a four-fold price
demanded in its stead. <a name="citation67"></a><a

following extract is made from Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s instructions to
his attorney, when the reference was proceeding, and it is
inserted to demonstrate that he was desirous of nothing but an
equitable adjustment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every thing depends upon proving the
quantity of dung, over and above the small quantity of straw
taken away, only 27 tons 13 cwt. 1 qr. 12 lbs, according to their
estimation.&nbsp; And they take it landlord&rsquo;s measure, 20
acres, instead of 18, and make 40 nominal loads, when in fact
there were only 13.&nbsp; Let us only establish the quantity of
dung, and then I will make the following proposal, as I have kept
a sufficient quantity of dung always by me, on purpose to carry,
whenever I knew how much would satisfy.&nbsp; Let them state the
price of <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>the dung per load, to be paid in money in one month, or
the dung to be delivered in two months, double the weight of the
hay taken a way, that is two loads for one, after allowing for
what has been carried, and let me chose which I will do, and that
will save all disputes about the value of the dung.&nbsp; Or if
they like it better, I will state the price, and they shall chuse
either money or dung.&rdquo; <a name="citation69"></a><a

<p>Besides these losses, Mr. Elsee is a considerable loser by Mr.
Mee&rsquo;s valuing 94 acres of oat and bean straw, namely all
the straw upon the farm, when no such thing was ever mentioned,
or thought of, either by the new tenant or Mr. Elsee; as the
wheat straw and the field are particularly mentioned in the
memorandum made at the time, July 14, so that instead <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of making an
allowance for dung upon 96 acres of wheat, at what they call a
load, at 2 load to an acre, or 192 load of dung, they have
deducted from the valuation of Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s property 392
load of dung at 12<i>s.</i> per load, (as he has been informed)
making 215<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> but afterwards, when they found
their mistake, and Mr. Driver and Mr. Mee were fearful that upon
this and other points the award would be set aside, Mr. Driver
became very cautious, and refused to interfere, saying it was all
Mr. Mee&rsquo;s doing, <i>and pretty doing it was</i>.</p>
<p>When Mr. Elsee applied to Mr. Ellis for the payment for some
seed beans and land rolls, and the two stacks of hay sold him in
September, he said he would pay for the things as valued by Mr.
Mee.&nbsp; To this Mr. Elsee objected, and having found Mr. Mee
in Romford Market, he told him in the presence of the new tenant
that he had no right to mix the property of the crown and what
had been sold to the new tenant together; and that as Mr. Ellis
wanted to settle, and he wanted his money, if <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the umpire
would look into his books, and say the value of the two
hay-stacks, and the wheat straw, although valued ever so low, he
would, according to his agreement, take the money, and settle
with the new tenant, but that he had no right to mix the things
to be paid for by the crown with the other property; and that as
to the oat and bean straw, not one word had been mentioned about
selling it, by any of the parties, as it was never intended to be
sold, <i>that</i> and the hay from the stacks at Windmill Hill
being all the cattle had to live upon from Michaelmas to
Lady-day; and that as to the award, he was confident it must be
set aside, as the allowance for dung to which they had no claim
amounted to more than the rent owing to them; and as he had
agreed to enable Mr. Driver to fulfil his engagement with the new
tenant, by furnishing him with dung for the ensuing crops, the
arbitrators surely did not mean to make him pay over again in
money.&nbsp; Mr. Mee appeared confused, <i>and refused to state
the value of the hay and straw separately</i>.&nbsp; With respect
to the oat and bean straw, <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>when Mr. Driver found it was not
intended to be sold, <i>he himself furnished Mr. Ellis with the
amount</i>, <i>and ordered him to deduct it out of the sum to be
paid</i>; <i>this Mr. Driver could do</i>, <i>independent of Mr.
Mee</i>; <i>but the charge against</i> Mr. Elsee <i>for the</i>

<p>Thus was Mr. Elsee, in one year, deprived of more than
<i>three thousand pounds</i>, as the result of his anxious desire
to oblige the Commissioners, and to accommodate the views of Mr.
Driver.&nbsp; To this alone has this injustice&mdash;we had
almost called it <i>robbery</i>&mdash;been owing.&nbsp; As a
tenant at will, he would have been only liable to his customary
rent; he could have carried off his crops, sold the dung, removed
his fixtures, and left a worthless occupancy to the crown; but
because he was anxious to accommodate himself to the best
interests <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>of all parties, <i>and incautiously put himself in the
hands of</i> Mr. Driver, he has been marked out for a series of
wrongs and oppressions that are scarcely to be credited; but it
is yet to be hoped that he may obtain redress.&nbsp; The
<i>blame</i> at present may rest only with the inferior agents of
the crown, and the Commissioners have the means, nor shall we
doubt of their disposition to do right; but if their servants can
intercept the claim for justice, there is no step left but an
appeal to the legislature to expose the wrong, and prove that the
boast of <i>equal law</i> is an idle mockery in England.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to shew, from the quantity of meadow
land, <i>that no such quantity of hay could have been grown</i>,
<i>as that for which the dung was claimed</i>.&nbsp; This we
shall do by inserting the following document, of the authenticity
of which there can be no question, as it is a copy of the
estimated quantity of the land, arable and meadow and pasture,
made by Mr. Driver himself, and printed in the proposals for
letting the farms, when they were taken by Mr. Ellis.</p>

first column contains the quantify of arable, and the second of
meadow and pasture land, estimated by landlord&rsquo;s measure,
that is including roads, ditches, &amp;c.&nbsp; This also
includes the homestead, farm-yard, &amp;c. places which certainly
could not be mowed for hay.&nbsp; In the third column is given
the real quantity of land that was mowed, not including the
<i>waste land</i>, and land newly laid down to grass.</p>
<p>Of the meadow laud, there were 143 acres, which was estimated
by Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s opponents themselves as producing 1&frac14;
load per acre, and this would amount to about 178 loads.&nbsp;
There were 81 acres, which was estimated to produce three
quarters of a load per acre, and this amounts to about 60
loads.&nbsp; The waste land comprized about 56 acres, which was
estimated at half a load an acre, making about 33 loads.&nbsp;
Adding these together, we have a total of 271 loads, as the whole
produce of the meadow land; and from this is to be deducted 123
loads which were valued to Mr. Ellis, and this leaves only 148
loads to be accounted for by Mr. Elsee.&nbsp; Of this quantity,
as appears by his books <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>he has sold 119 loads, the remaining
29 being eaten by his cattle on the premises.&nbsp; Nothing can
be clearer than this detail, the facts and figures of which speak
for themselves.</p>
<p>Another corroboration of this calculation is to be found in
Mr. Mee&rsquo;s award, (<i>see page</i> <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page55">55</a></span>) which
amounts to 384<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> but deducting 35<i>l.</i>
7<i>s.</i> for the oat and bean straw, 10<i>l.</i> for the chaff,
30<i>l.</i> for the fixtures, and 29<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> for his
expences, leaves only 279<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> for 132 acres of
the best meadow land, and 100 acres of wheat straw.</p>

<p>Yet it was calculated by one Harding, who was a <i>jobbing
carpenter</i>, that 256 loads were to <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>be accounted for, besides the 123
valued to Mr. Ellis, which makes 379 loads, that is 108 loads
<i>more than the land could produce</i>.&nbsp; The question here
is, <i>how came this carpenter employed</i>?&nbsp; <i>The
arbitrators and umpire</i>, <i>one would think</i>, <i>might have
measured a hay-stack</i>, <i>without his aid</i>, <i>as they knew
so well how to charge for doing it</i>.&mdash;But they perhaps
wanted some one <i>to bear out their statements</i>, and the
following anecdote will shew that Harding was finely adapted for
their purpose.</p>
<p>This Harding 20 years ago lived in Hertfordshire, where he
failed as a farmer, and travelling into Essex, he followed his
original business of a carpenter.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee was building a
new house near Romford, and employed him as one of the
carpenters.&nbsp; At the same time a bricklayer named Jervis was
engaged to do the plastering by the yard, and his work to a
certain extent had been measured and paid for.&mdash;But some
time after Jervis informed Mr. Elsee he had made a great mistake,
as the work came to <i>three times as much as was made of
it</i>.&nbsp; After some enquiry it turned out that one of the
carpenters, <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span><i>this very Harding</i>, had been measuring it for
him.&nbsp; On this it was remeasured, and it was found to be
<i>less than he had been paid for</i>; and then Harding found out
that <i>he had measured his feet by</i> 3 <i>instead of</i> 9
<i>to the square yard</i>.&nbsp; They were both discharged for
this, but Harding took care to measure the haystack <i>by
himself</i>!</p>
<p>After this it may not be surprising that he should say the
stacks were 15 or 16 feet high, when every farmer knows they are
seldom more than 6 feet to the eaves.&nbsp; And as further proof
of his honesty and ability he said 8 inches was the average
height of a truss of hay, when some of this was of the worst
quality, and the trusses measured from 14 to 16 inches.&nbsp;
This was deposed to by the hay-binders, and all the
witnesses.&nbsp; Williams particularly said he was obliged to
borrow larger carts, as the hay was so bulky, he could not load
it upon his own.</p>
<p>A most, impertinent attempt was made to discredit the accounts
of Mr. Elsee, but they happened to be kept in an old book of
trading accounts, <i>and were folioed from the beginning more
</i><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span><i>than 20 years ago</i>, so that any deception was out
of the question.&nbsp; This impertinence is the more
reprehensible, as coming from one who had not hesitated to
<i>falsify</i> the evidence of one John Young, whose statement
<i>exactly corresponded</i> with Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s accounts.</p>
<p>Mr. Elsee is further charged with being the cause of the suit
about the dung, as he refused to abide by an agreement made
between him and Mr. Ellis in February, 1821, when it was agreed
at Mr. Ellis&rsquo;s house, in the presence of Mr. W. Masterman,
that each should name a friend; <i>but it was particularly
mentioned that neither Mr. Mee</i>, <i>nor Mr. Driver</i>,
<i>should have any concern in the business</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Benton,
of Hornchurch, and Mr. Carter of Chigwell were named, and the
White Horse, Romford, fixed as a place to meet at when
convenient.&nbsp; Mr. Ellis wrote a paper, and read it to Mr.
Elsee; it was signed, and put into Mr. Masterman&rsquo;s hands;
in a short time the meeting was appointed, and the parties, with
Mr. Carter and Mr. Benton, met in Romford market, and were about
to go to business, but Mr. Ellis declined till a friend <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>came whom he
expected every minute.&nbsp; The parties waited more than an
hour, <i>when who should arrive</i>, <i>but</i> Mr. Mee <i>and
his Son</i>!&nbsp; An altercation took place, and the business
was not proceeded in, but no one was to blame for this, except
Mr. Ellis, for introducing Mr. Mee contrary to the stipulation
that he was to have nothing to do in the affair.&nbsp; Mr. Carter
and Mr. Elsee were ready to meet Mr. Benton, but refused to admit
Mr. Mee and his Son.&nbsp; Mr. Masterman then gave the paper they
had signed to Mr. Elsee, who handed it to Mr. Ellis, but the
latter handed it back to Mr. Elsee, as his nephew Smith had taken
a copy.</p>
<p>In conclusion we shall merely exhibit at one view the sum
total of the pecuniary injury that Mr. Elsee has sustained
directly and indirectly in these transactions.</p>

result requires no comment; but in addition to this plunder of
property, there is the mental torture, and its consequent bodily
suffering, which cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>These circumstances would have been long since laid before the
public, but from various perplexities, and the very disastrous
events that arose out of this ruinous litigation.&nbsp; For some
time Mr. Elsee had hopes of being able to defend himself, as an
eminent counsel told him he had a cause that would triumph in any
tribunal besides the chancery side of the exchequer.&nbsp; And,
on the reference, he was assured that nothing could destroy the
decisive proof in his favor.&nbsp; But all this was fallacious!
and only helped to involve him deeper and deeper in expensive
consequences.</p>
<p>He has, however, though late, been able to arrange these
matters for publication; and to take those steps that are yet
open to him, as a British subject, to obtain redress and
indemnification; and the length of time that has passed since the
injury, furnishes an additional reason why justice should now be
the more promptly administered.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>There
are various minor circumstances that accompanied this before
unheard of persecution, which we purposely omit to mention,
although they strongly illustrate the <i>system</i> of vindictive

extend to too great a length, and we have already made out a case
which needs no farther illustration.&nbsp; We therefore leave it

party aggrieved will at least have the consolation of knowing
that he has done his duty in protesting against the wrongs which
have been inflicted upon him under the mask of law, and from a
quarter where he ought rather to have met with protection than
plunder.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>To the
public, and to those who are invested with authority for the
security of the public interests, the judgment is referred,
without any apprehension of what the public opinion will be,
whatever influence may be employed to prejudice the minds of
those who have the decision in their hands, as far as the
interests of the individual are concerned.&nbsp; To them the
appeal will be forthwith made; and to complete the case, we
purpose giving the result in an appendix, that a useful example
may be set to other sufferers under undeserved injuries, of the
advantage of a persevering pursuit of justice; or a beacon set up
to warn crown tenants against putting themselves in the power of
such men as Mr. Elsee has had to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="footnote8"></a><a href="#citation8"
class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; A striking instance occurs, on the
very spot where Mr. Elsee has been insulted and plundered, of the
extremity to which outrage can be carried, when the poor only are
concerned.&nbsp; About the 1st of September, 1811, Mr. Elsee
expected a few friends at his house on a shooting party, and had
ordered a gun to be brought from Havering Park farm to his house
at Chigwell Row.&nbsp; One of his servants was taking the gun, in
pursuance of this order, in company with another who was driving
home a team of horses.&nbsp; While these men were thus proceeding
in their lawful business, on the public road, and in the light of
day, they were shot at, without any offence, without any warning,
and without seeing the lurking assassins, who thought fit to
sport in this way with human life, and who turned out to be John
Laver, his majesty&rsquo;s woodward, and John Giffin, well known
on the forest as Black Jack, an under-keeper.&nbsp; The servant
who was driving the horses was dreadfully wounded; his hand,
thigh, and leg were torn by slugs and dog-shot, many of which had
lodged in the flesh; and the cowardly keepers, thinking this poor
fellow had suffered enough, permitted him to crawl home; but they
seized the man who carried the gun, and carried him a prisoner to
Hog-hill House.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee, after directing the man&rsquo;s
wounds to be dressed, procured the liberation of his other
servant, and obtained a warrant against the two keepers, who were
brought before the Rev. Mr. Layton for examination.&nbsp; The
fellows admitted the servants were walking quietly along the
road; but they said they had heard a gun fired about that part,
an hour and a half before; a most admirable reason, it must be
confessed, for shooting his majesty&rsquo;s subjects in the high
road!&nbsp; Laver admitted also that he had never seen the men
before; and when the magistrate expressed some surprize at his
conduct, his majesty&rsquo;s woodward, who was the person who had
fired the gun, coolly answered, that he knew very well when to
shoot!&mdash;Laver was committed for further examination, and as
there was no proof that Giffin was aiding and abetting in the
murderous transaction, he was discharged.&nbsp; So far all was in
the ordinary course of business; but the next examination was
attended by Admiral Harvey, M.P. for the county, and one of the
Verdurers of the Forest, who insisted upon it that the offence
was bailable; and although this was pointedly denied by the Rev.
Mr. Layton, his brother magistrate, the superior authority of
that sapient member of the legislature prevailed, and the
blood-thirsty woodward was actually bailed, and bailed too in the
paltry sum of fifty pounds, to appear and take his trial for a
capital offence.&nbsp; Here began the mockery of the law, and the
conclusion was worthy of such a beginning.&nbsp; At the next
assizes a bill was preferred before the grand jury, upon Lord
Ellenborough&rsquo;s act, and Admiral Harvey, being a member of
the grand jury, undertook the disposal of the affair.&nbsp; He
began by asking the man who had been wounded, and his
fellow-servant, whether they had a hundred a year?&nbsp; The poor
fellows were day labourers, and of course were obliged to answer
the impartial and enlightened questioner in the negative.&nbsp;
Upon this, the bill was thrown out, as if cutting and maiming day
labourers was no sort of offence in this land of freedom; and
leaving it to be inferred, by the admiring inhabitants of
Hainault Forest, that persons not possessed of a hundred a year,
were as fair game to the king&rsquo;s woodward, and the keepers,
as the vermin of the forest itself.</p>
<p><a name="footnote15"></a><a href="#citation15"
class="footnote">[15]</a>&nbsp; By the exertions of Mr. Elsee,
five true bills were found against the king&rsquo;s woodward for
stealing timber.&nbsp; He was convicted upon the first, and not
tried upon the others.&nbsp; But instead of being transported, a
fate which might have waited an honester man, he made interest
somewhere to obtain a pardon!&nbsp; Nor was this all; for, in a
short time he was restored to his place on the forest, as if for
the express purpose of affording every facility to the progress
of timber stealing.&nbsp; As might be expected, in the following
year, as Mr. Elsee and the Deputy Surveyor were riding in the
forest, they found one Wilson, who had been a witness against the
convicted woodward, Cowderoy, and several others, cutting down
oak pollards.&nbsp; In this ride alone, no less than 48 stubs, or
stools, of oaks were seen, that had been recently cut down
without any authority; and the Deputy Surveyor told Wilson, the
way they went on outstripped all their former proceedings in this
respect.&nbsp; Yet no notice was taken or all this; and when
another person, named Smith, some time after was detected in
cutting down young spear oaks, in the month of October, carting
them home before daylight, and hiding them on his premises, the
proper authorities were in some way or other prevented from
interfering; and the law expences which were entailed upon Mr.
Elsee, for his exertions to prevent such depredations, amounted
to more than a thousand pounds.</p>
<p><a name="footnote19"></a><a href="#citation19"
class="footnote">[19]</a>&nbsp; In the printed conditions for the
letting of these farms, a very extraordinary difference was
observable between that in the possession of Mr. Elsee, and the
rest.&nbsp; This difference consisted in a stipulation respecting
a certain proportion of dung to be brought in return for the hay
and straw carried off the farm; a stipulation not extended to two
other farms, let at the same time, and to the same person; and
this stipulation had been made without consulting Mr. Elsee,
although he was then merely a tenant at will, holding the land to
suit the convenience of the crown, which had no claim on him for
any thing beyond the rent; and as he had paid for the dung on his
entrance upon the farm, it was as much his property as the hay
and corn, and he had an undoubted right to take away or sell all
crops, dung, &amp;c. up to the period of his leaving the farm;
nor could the crown have interfered in any way to prevent his
disposing as he pleased of his own property; but Mr. Driver,
under promise of some advantages and accommodations, which were
never realized, induced him to sign an agreement which left him
at the mercy of Mr. Driver, and the consequences were indeed
disastrous to the interests of Mr. Elsee.</p>
<p><a name="footnote23"></a><a href="#citation23"
class="footnote">[23]</a>&nbsp; This seems extraordinary language
for the lips of an agent of a public board; and particularly
after his letter, as given in page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page18">18</a></span>, where he states that he was
commissioned to receive offers for the letting of the farms,
which he after pretended to say had not been surrendered.&nbsp;
Whether this was merely a contrivance to get Mr. Elsee into the
dilemma in which he afterwards found himself so fatally involved,
we must leave our readers to determine for themselves.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25"
class="footnote">[25]</a>&nbsp; The condition proposed was that
two load of rotten spit dung was to be brought on to the farm for
every load of hay carried off, and one load of spit dung for
every load of straw carried off the farm.&nbsp; With this
condition, as we have shewn, Mr. Elsee had no right to comply;
but when he had been deceived into the signature of the
agreement, he became bound for its performance, and was prepared
to carry this condition into effect.&nbsp; He was, however,
prevented from doing this, as we shall shew hereafter, by the
extraordinary conduct of the arbitrators, and their umpire, and
was then compelled to pay more for the dung required under this
condition than the hay and straw sold for, in addition to the
cost of an exchequer process.&nbsp; This is being a tenant of
crown land to some purpose.</p>
<p><a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26"
class="footnote">[26]</a>&nbsp; This fact would almost afford
conclusive evidence in a court of equity, that the condition
about the dung was one of the meshes of the net intentionally
framed to prevent Mr. Elsee from escaping the &ldquo;ruin,&rdquo;
that had been threatened.&nbsp; And such a conclusion would be
further strengthened, by the total disregard of every
consideration and stipulation in behalf of Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s
interests.&nbsp; We shall hereafter shew the difference observed
when Mr. Elsee had to pay, and when he had to receive; and if the
reader be a tenant of crown lands, he may make some use of the
lesson afforded him, in similar cases.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27"></a><a href="#citation27"
class="footnote">[27]</a>&nbsp; This purpose, it might be harsh
to guess was a determination to do any wanton injury to Mr.
Elsee; but in the face of the proof that no legal proceedings
were necessary to obtain possession of the farm, and that they
were persisted in when the crown could derive no benefit from
them, as if with no other object than to compel Mr. Elsee to sign
the agreement, of which every advantage was ultimately taken
against him, while he was obstinately denied, or cunningly
deprived of the benefit of the trifling stipulations in his
favor, there is a very strong inference that fair play was not
intended, and that the power was sought, with a wish to abuse
it.</p>
<p><a name="footnote28"></a><a href="#citation28"
class="footnote">[28]</a>&nbsp; Private calamity weighs but
little with public men; and with some persons it may perhaps
appear unimportant to state, that the anxiety and enormous
expences attendant on the legal proceedings into which Mr. Elsee
was plunged by the natural desire of protecting his property as
far as he could, preyed so much upon the spirits of Mrs. Elsee,
that there is great reason to apprehend they accelerated, and
perhaps occasioned the disease which carried her to the
grave.</p>
<p><a name="footnote29"></a><a href="#citation29"
class="footnote">[29]</a>&nbsp; The difficulty of contending with
the crown is proverbial, and the reason is obvious.&nbsp; The
crown has always a host of legal assistants arrayed on its side,
and those who in any way contest the claims set up by its agents
on its behalf, are looked upon rather as culprits by certain
persons, than as parties in a cause.&nbsp; Because the crown has
no interest in harrassing the subject, it is too hastily
concluded that its agents are never influenced by improper,
personal, and vindictive motives; and many a man has been ruined
at the suit of the crown, for no other offence than that of not
bowing low enough, or bidding high enough, to its servants.&nbsp;
We have heard of an instance, in which a servant of the crown
became the bitter enemy of one of its tenants, after having very
freely partaken of his hospitality, because the lady of the
official gentleman thought herself not treated with all the
respect to which she imagined herself to be entitled, by the
female portion of the family of the crown tenant, although it is
possible that the lady had received as much as she could fairly
claim, if all the truth were stated.&nbsp; Now an offence of this
sort, committed hard upon the expiration of a lease, against one
who had the ear of the great men, might produce a great many
difficulties about a renewal that would otherwise have been the
easiest matter in the world.&nbsp; If nothing could be said
against the individual as a tenant, it might be hinted that his
politics were not of the right orthodox description, and that his
rent was a great deal too low for a friend of liberal
opinions.&nbsp; And if any dispute should arise, out of which a
law-suit could be picked, no better revenge could be devised, if
every one were as unfortunate at law as Mr. Elsee.</p>
<p><a name="footnote31"></a><a href="#citation31"
class="footnote">[31]</a>&nbsp; It may be asked, why was Mr.
Elsee compelled to sign, as the action was not brought against
him.&nbsp; The answer is, that his property was on the
ground&mdash;that his crops would have been seized&mdash;that he
would have had all the inconvenience to bear throughout, and all
the expence in the first instance, with the difficulty of
proceeding against executors, from whom he might not have been
able to have recovered anything.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee, therefore, had
no hope of escaping without injury, but by placing confidence in
the professions that were made on behalf of the crown, and he was
deceived.</p>
<p><a name="footnote47"></a><a href="#citation47"
class="footnote">[47]</a>&nbsp; This, it is admitted, even by Mr.
Driver, was not taken into any account, and he is obliged to
admit that it ought to have been; yet when Mr. Elsee took him the
receipts, and required to be reimbursed the money, upon the
Surveyor&rsquo;s own confession that it was due, he would give
nothing but evasive answers.&nbsp; Being pressed very closely
upon the subject, he said he would not pay it then, and he has
taken care not to pay it since, nor has Mr. Elsee ever been able
to obtain it from anybody else.&nbsp; This circumstance of
omitting to take the land-tax into the account, proves the
necessity there was for a proper enquiry, and the examination of
the party, as to claims, &amp;c. and this circumstance alone
would have been sufficient to destroy the award, in the court of
king&rsquo;s bench, if the case could have been taken there,
instead of being pounded in the equity side of the court of
exchequer.</p>
<p><a name="footnote56"></a><a href="#citation56"
class="footnote">[56]</a>&nbsp; In all the proceedings the dung
appears to have been a favorite consideration with Mr. Driver and
Mr. Mee; and by some means or other they contrived to make Mr.
Elsee pay more, in dung and money, than the crops were worth; and
he would absolutely have been a considerable gainer, if he had
left the hay to rot on the ground, instead of sending it to
market under the conditions imposed upon him.</p>
<p><a name="footnote57"></a><a href="#citation57"
class="footnote">[57]</a>&nbsp; The costs of this award are also
objectionable, inasmuch as the time occupied was charged, and
that exorbitantly too, in the business between Mr. Elsee and the
Commissioners; and if they had thrown in the latter award, late
and defective, and injurious to Mr. Elsee as it was, there would
have been no great sacrifice on their part; the more especially
as Mr. Elsee never agreed to the introduction of an umpire, nor
agreed to be bound by the decision of any person, except the
arbitrators, who were merely requested for an opinion to prevent
any altercation between the buyer and seller.&nbsp; And the
parties seem rather to have been aware that some objection might
be made to paying them, so they prudently contrived to pay
themselves, in the following ingenious manner.&nbsp; Mr. Elsee
had employed Mr. Peake, at the Michaelmas of that year, to sell
his farming stock, and from the produce of the sale Mr. Peake
deducted the whole sum, and furnished Mr. Elsee with a
receipt.&nbsp; This was another deviation from the award, for it
required each pay to half, but then they had no money in hand of
Mr. Ellis&rsquo;s, and the safest way was to make sure of a
pay-master.&nbsp; The amount is only large in comparison with the
duty; but it deserves notice, as one amongst many proofs that Mr.
Elsee&rsquo;s purse was never to be spared.</p>
<p><a name="footnote59"></a><a href="#citation59"
class="footnote">[59]</a>&nbsp; The award was for 384<i>l.</i>
18<i>s.</i> but this included, as the arbitrators and umpire
afterwards discovered; some oat and bean straw, not intended to
have been valued to Mr. Ellis; and this was deducted, three years
afterwards, by Mr. Driver&rsquo;s orders, which proves the power
of this gentleman to rectify any mistake that might be in favor
of Mr. Ellis, although he could not interfere with Mr.
Mee&rsquo;s award when the object was to do justice to Mr. Elsee,
even in the small matter of the land-tax.&nbsp; It does not
appear, however, by the Inventory that the articles sold had been
much over valued to Mr. Ellis; but if the Surveyor had ordered
nothing to be paid, we suppose his order would have been
omnipotent.</p>
<p><a name="footnote65"></a><a href="#citation65"
class="footnote">[65]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Mee and Mr. Harding went to
measure this stack of hay in December, unknown to Mr.
Elsee.&nbsp; Now the hay was got in, in July and August; and the
question here is, why the arbitrators and umpire did not measure
the stack before the award was made, on the 29th of October, that
the matter might have been adjusted at once, by stating the
quantity of dung which was required to be brought.&nbsp; Instead
of this, no account of the quantity of hay appears to have been
taken, before this private measurement of Mr. Mee and Mr.
Harding, which was thus clandestinely made to furnish evidence on
the reference; and in point of justice Mr. Elsee ought to have
been acquainted with this proceeding, that he might have had some
one present on his part, to see the measurement was justly
made.&nbsp; If the arbitrators and umpire had done their duty at
a proper time, Mr. Elsee&rsquo;s presence might not have been
requisite; but against this underhanded proceeding at such a
rime, he has a right to protest.</p>
<p><a name="footnote67"></a><a href="#citation67"
class="footnote">[67]</a>&nbsp; Mr. French, in 1805, when
estimating the value of farming stock, &amp;c. in Essex, (the
same county) rates the dung in the yard, as worth only 2s. 6d.
per load; and when carted and turned over, at but 3s. 6d.&nbsp;
As he was calculating the full cost of every thing, this may be
taken as a fair average of the price for the county; yet
witnesses were found to rate it at 20s. per load; and, what in
more extraordinary, a Referee allowed it.&nbsp; It may be added
that this estimate of Mr. French is that of a practical former,
that it was made in the neighbourhood of Romford, and that the
object was to shew the full extent of the expence of entering
upon a farm.</p>
<p><a name="footnote69"></a><a href="#citation69"
class="footnote">[69]</a>&nbsp; This candid proposition, perhaps,
was not submitted to the Referee, or he could hardly have
declined it.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr. Elsee frequently wished to address
Mr. Bolland himself, and point out the very clear state of the
case; but he was always prevented, by a promise of some future
opportunity.&nbsp; And when he attempted to do so, at the close
of the proceedings, he was informed it was too late, and that he
must sit down.&nbsp; Mr. Bolland then applied himself to form his
award upon some grounds that we cannot understand; and arrived at
the wonderful conclusion that the dung was worth considerably
more than the hay fetched at market!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
